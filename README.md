# Duy's Simple Portfolio
A simple version of my portfolio

It utilizes vanilla HTML/CSS to create a sleek simple looks with some effects. I do realize that I added some animations in places that may make it seem inconsistent with the rest of the page but I was mostly proud of being able to complete it, and I may work to implement it in the future as this is on-going. The design I had was inspired by various portfolios that I skimmed from another repository from here, https://github.com/emmabostian/developer-portfolios. I hope to use this as a general basis, so that I may refactor a different version of this using different API libraries and tech stacks like the ones listed on it. This is the portfolio I will be using to show off for now until I fully implement more.

The lack of projects on the page will be changed soon once I complete more and feel that they are worthy of being on the page, as I am continuing to learn and improve on this journey. I hope that this can be used for other developers to look at the different things they can do and how simple can look just as good as the modern day looks without the use of several tools.

The only real interactive object besides the contact form, which does actually send messages to my emails, is the navbar which will adjust accordingly if the site is viewed on mobile or on browser sizes that fit a similar size.
