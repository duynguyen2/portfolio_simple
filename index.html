        <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Growing up in San Francisco for almost all of my life in an immigrant family, my parents were not always readily available to take care of me when the need arose. 
            I grew interested in learning about tech from playing video games when I grew up, mostly playing on a Playstation 2 that was originally gifted to my sister but 
            she hardly really used it. Afterwards, I started gaining interest in using a computer, where I learned about PC gaming and did all the tips and tricks to try 
            to run current and popular games at the time on a very low-spec office-style computer.  As I was in high school, they were offering Computer Science courses, 
            one that taught the basics using Scratch and one that was an AP class learning the how to program with Java. Going into San Francisco State University, I wanted 
            to try to diversify since Computer Science was beginning to become impacted and more people had interested so I decided to do Computer Engineering. After graduating while 
            COVID-19 was still forcing people at home, it was very tough to find jobs out the market until I was able to land one as a helpdesk technician. At this time, I realized 
            my passion was still in programming and software engineering but Java was just not as fun, so I decided to step into learning front-end with HTML/CSS and React and while I 
            am self-taught using things like Codecademy, I am still learning but quick to adapting to building new ideas.
